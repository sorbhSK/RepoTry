        No, the event loop in JavaScript does not necessarily execute tasks starting from the oldest first. The event
        loop follows a specific order of execution, and it processes tasks based on their priority and the type of task.

        The event loop consists of several phases:

        Macrotask Queue Execution (Callback Queue): This includes tasks such as script execution, I/O operations, and
        setTimeout/setInterval callbacks. The event loop picks the oldest task from the macrotask queue and executes it.

        Microtask Queue Execution (Job Queue): This includes tasks such as Promise callbacks (resolved or rejected) and
        Mutation Observer callbacks. The event loop executes all microtasks in the microtask queue before moving on to
        the next macrotask.

        The key point to note is that within a single tick of the event loop, all microtasks are executed before moving
        on to the next macrotask. Microtasks have higher priority than macrotasks in the event loop.

        Here's a simplified flow:

        -Execute all microtasks in the microtask queue.
        -Pick and execute the oldest macrotask from the macrotask queue.
        -Repeat the process.


        This order ensures that microtasks are processed before moving on to the next macrotask. The event loop aims to
        maintain responsiveness and prioritize tasks that are more immediate, such as handling user interactions or
        resolving promises.

        It's important to understand this behavior when working with asynchronous JavaScript, as it can affect the order
        of execution and impact the performance of your applications.
